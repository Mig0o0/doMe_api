## About Project

DoMe Api, is an API for my own application idea, which depends on the requirement of nested tasks, while i can nest more tasks so i can cut off a project to exactly atomic tasks. 

## Project Timing & Code Breif

This project comes out with only laravel basic, so it was the first time i wrote a laravel application with and idea of solid principles that laravel provides.
